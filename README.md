# Render-Notification
Sends a simple email message informing the user that his render's complete
#NOTE that the email entered is sender / receiver
Made this simple script because ray tracing renders usually take quite some time and would be quite helpful to be notified of its completion

1-Go to referances --> Add-Ons --> install --> install the .py / rar file
