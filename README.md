# Render-Notification
Sends a simple email message informing the user that his render's complete
Made this simple script because ray tracing renders usually take quite some time and would be quite helpful to be notified of its completion


TODO:
    Add renders metadata to the email, But since this feature is not yet available "https://developer.blender.org/T84598" i will have to implement one myself
